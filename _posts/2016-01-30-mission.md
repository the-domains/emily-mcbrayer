My passion is to help you help others.

I believe the world needs your hands.

I believe in the power of human touch to improve lives, heal deeply, and ultimately change the world.

I believe that when you make someone look better they feel better and go out into the world ready to share their own gifts.

I believe it's my calling to advance the beauty & wellness industry by helping you create the best treatments and offerings, giving you the tools to build your practice, and the confidence to create a career you love.

I believe in sharing everything I've learned in over 10 years designing, developing, and growing The Spa at Oak Haven Resort. Using creative treatment design combined with a passion for customer service I've grown the business from zero clients to over 25,000 raving fans. 

I believe the secret to any successful spa, salon, or individual in this industry is to harness the power of your unique personality to create a large following of exceptionally loyal customers. I believe you can do the same and make more money than you ever thought possible.

I believe the power is in your hands to create a business and life you truly adore.
